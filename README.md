# RQP-MPER

The official repository of the Environment Agency’s River Quality Planning (RQP) and Metals Permitting (MPER) software tools. 

## About the project

The Environment Agency uses the RQP-MPER modelling toolset for water quality planning and permitting purposes. RQP (River Quality Planning) and MPER (Bio-available metals permitting) are used by the Environment Agency’s National Permitting Service as well as area and operational teams to determine emission conditions for discharges. RQP is one of the main tools used for discharge permitting and water management in the UK.

The Environment Agency has made these tools available as Open-Source software and are hosted in this repository. The repository contains the latest releases of the tools as standalone executables, the source code, documentation and guidance for contributing.
